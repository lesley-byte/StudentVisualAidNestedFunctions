# Nesting Functions Demonstration

![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Overview

This project is a simple web demonstration designed to help students learn about JavaScript function nesting and scope. It visually represents how functions are called and how variables are passed and manipulated within nested functions.

## Features

- **Interactive Inputs**: Users can enter values for herbs and care levels, which dynamically update the parameters passed to the functions.
- **Function Display**: The JavaScript function structure is displayed on the page, helping users visualize how the function is built and executed.
- **Console Output**: A simulated console shows what happens when functions are called, including any console log outputs.
- **Control Buttons**: Users can execute the functions with customized parameters and stop the function execution as needed.
